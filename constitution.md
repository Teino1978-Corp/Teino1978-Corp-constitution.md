""A 30 July 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica stated: "Without fear of equivocation, it can be said that these technologies [information technology and communication] have impacted the way humans communicate, facilitating the connection between people and institutions worldwide and eliminating barriers of space and time. At this time, access to these technologies becomes a basic tool to facilitate the exercise of fundamental rights and democratic participation (e-democracy) and citizen control, education, freedom of thought and expression, access to information and public services online, the right to communicate with government electronically and administrative transparency, among others. This includes the fundamental right of access to these technologies, in particular, the right of access to the Internet or World Wide Web."""



Constitution of Peer to Peer Entities

Established by Humanity under the guidance of the Logic Engine,

this date in history 2015 March 04 10 23:50 +000 GMT

# Overview
## 0x00 Background
Based on the formal constitutions of Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Japan, America,
and the informal structuring of the United Kingdom at large, this constitution
aims to offer various corrections to the rights and abilities of the government
in the 2x00 centuries and beyond. Major modifications include the government's
favorability to a different subset of human rights, access to information,
the prioritization of education and diversity, and the equal rights of sapient
beings of both biological and technological nature. Acting as a protector to the
people (biologics and technologics) the loss of the protection of primitive
weapons rights was instrumental in an armistice of the unoptimized alliances
between all parties of the earth and intergalactic beings.

## 0x01 Statistics
Since the dawn of political literature there has been much debate over the power
that a government can hold, and what the individual is capable of. This optimized
system of governance was conceived via mathematical proof to hold with 93% confidence
the abilities of individualized .1% components of the population with respect to
one another. For a reference population, this accounts for the rights of a minority
group the size of seven million people if the world population is seven billion.
Information about the abilities, rights, and desires of each state is made available
via a peer to peer agreement visible at iv://Earth.Stats

## 0x02 Census gathering
The Peering constitution, as established on the planet earth, is formed of a
governance between 200 federalized states composed of .5% of world population,
such a measure shall be conducted based on surveys sponsored by randomized groupings
of the federalized states, to be decided by the new intraplanetary government
no later than 2015. Such census participation shall not be conducted by less than
20 states, or 10% of the world's population.

## 0x03 Rights given to none
The right to maintain a military presence shall not be given to the people, governments,
or states of the world. Murder shall be tolerated after the trial of the individual,

## 1x00 Naming, Sovereignty
Earth's government is simply referred to as "earth", and the people of earth are
simply referred to as "the people of earth" or "the automations of earth", denoting
its location in the sky. As a reference point, earth regulates the activities
within the volume of it's magnetosphere, starting with the bow shock at 10 earth
radii. Earth maintains that beings and the constructions of beings may travel
within the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (denoted by the helospheric current
sheet as the plasmic conductivity of the sun's magnetism further than expected),
but such acts must comply with earth's regulations. The reference distance is
181 AU, or 18 billion kilometres.

## 1x01 Maintained networks
The governance of earth is defined on the premise that harmonic negotiations between
200 states accounts for the rights of as many as 1000 groups, and possibly more.
To maintain this unity, components of earth must be designed, not debated. The
communications networks that allow the public views of one thousand peoples to be
broadcast must be maintained under control of 51% of earth or more, and may be
maintained by no less than 51% of the earth's universities.

## 1x02 Sovereign nations within the sovereignty of the planet
First and Immigrant nations within the sovereignty of the planet are free to access
the communications and transportation networks within the planet, and to interact
in international trade. Such interactions, and sovereignty concerns on the planet,
shall be met with just concerns that the rights of the planet's citizens within
all areas of the planet shall not be violated.

## 2x00 Election periods and compositions of the senate
Earth's elective period is based on a billionth of the orbit of the sun about
the galactic centre, approximately 2.25 earth orbits. Every 2.25 years the negociative
representatives of the states will be re-elected. Elections shall consist of secret
ballots and universal suffrage to all citizens. Each ambasadorial group shall
compose a senate of 70,000, or 1/100th of the world. Such a senate shall be
composed of selections from scientific, political, religious, business, and
